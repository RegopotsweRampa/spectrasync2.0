            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Welcome to SpectraSync. These Terms of Service ("Terms") outline the rules and regulations governing your engagement with SpectraSync ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please refrain from engaging our services.</p>

            <h3>1. Scope of Services</h3>

            <h3>2. Client Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>2.1 Clients must supply all required credentials, resources, or access to SpectraSync personnel. Clients are solely responsible for ensuring that this information is provided to authorized individuals only.</p>
            <p>2.2 Complex tasks requiring significant time or resources will include a documented scope of work. Changes to the agreed scope during the project will incur additional fees.</p>

            <h3>3. Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>3.1 Complex projects require an upfront payment of 40% of the total project cost. The remaining balance is due upon completion of the project.</p>
            <p>3.2 SpectraSync also offers monthly and hourly payment packages for specific services.</p>
            <p>3.3 Late payments exceeding 15 days from the due date will incur additional fees.</p>

            <h3>4. Delivery</h3>
            <p>4.1 SpectraSync guarantees the delivery of services as agreed, unless otherwise specified in the scope of work.</p>

            <h3>5. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>5.1 Clients and SpectraSync agree to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to protect sensitive information. Both parties must keep any confidential information obtained during the course of the project private.</p>

            <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>6.1 SpectraSync may use third-party services for certain projects. Clients will be informed when such services are used, and the terms of these third-party services may also apply.</p>

            <h3>7. Termination of Agreement</h3>
            <p>7.1 Either party may terminate this agreement by providing a 30-day notice. Upon termination, both parties agree to settle any outstanding dues for work completed up to the termination date.</p>
            <p>7.2 Grounds for termination include non-performance, failure to maintain agreed quality, missing critical deadlines, or other breaches of the terms.</p>
            <p>7.3 If SpectraSync fails to perform due to negligence or lack of resources, the client may terminate the agreement.</p>
            <p>7.4 A cure period of 14 days is available to address performance issues before termination is executed.</p>

            <h3>8. Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>8.1 Neither party shall be held liable for any delays or failures in performance caused by events beyond their control, including but not limited to acts of God, strikes, or governmental actions.</p>

            <h3>9. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>9.1 SpectraSync retains ownership of all intellectual property unless otherwise stated. Clients are not authorized to resell, distribute, or modify the delivered work unless explicitly stated in writing.</p>
